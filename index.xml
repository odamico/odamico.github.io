      <description>I am currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Technology degree in Informatics and Security at Seneca College. My tech journey began with Java programming for my highschool computer science classes. From there, I learned about computer hardware basics through private classes. So far studying at Seneca, I have learned networking, Linux system administration, C programming, computer forensics, reverse engineering, database administration, penetration testing, and so much more. In my free time I enjoy practicing these skills and tinkering around with my own personal tech projects, this blog is dedicated to demonstrating some of those projects.</description>

      <description>Hello world! Welcome to my new GitHub Pages blog This site was generated using Hugo, a fast and simple framework for building static webpages. Hugo works nicely with GitHub pages for hosting simple web content. I hope to post personal projects and guides related to information security, programming, game development, data science, and more!</description>
